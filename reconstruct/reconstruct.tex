By turning in this assignment, I agree by the Stanford honor code and declare
that all of this is my own work.

\section*{Problem 1}

\begin{enumerate}
\item To show that this greedy algorithm is suboptimal, simply consider the following set-up. First, we work with a $1$-gram model, and consider the input:
$$
\text{``thesecount'}
$$
The greedy algorithm will compare the following on the first iteration:
\begin{align*}
  &u(\text{``t''}) \\
  &u(\text{``th''}) \\
  &u(\text{``the''}) \\
  &u(\text{``thes''}) \\
  &u(\text{``these''}) \\
  &u(\text{``thesec''}) \\
  &u(\text{``theseco''}) \\
  &u(\text{``thesecou''}) \\
  &u(\text{``thesecoun''}) \\
  &u(\text{``thesecount''})
\end{align*}
From the above, it's reasonable to have our $1$-gram model such that $u(\text{``the''}) < u(\text{``these''})$, and both of these will obviously have lower cost than the other non-English words. Therefore, on the first iteration, our greedy algorithm will select the split:
$$
  ``\text{the secount}''
$$
On the second iteration, the algorithm will consider:
\begin{align*}
  &u(\text{``s''}) \\
  &u(\text{``se''}) \\
  &u(\text{``sec''}) \\
  &u(\text{``seco''}) \\
  &u(\text{``secou''}) \\
  &u(\text{``secoun''}) \\
  &u(\text{``secount''})
\end{align*}
Note that non of these are English words, and therefore we define them to have extremely high cost. For the sake of simplicity, we'll have $u(\text{``secount''})$ have the lowest cost amongts the above, but still have an extremely high cost since it's not an English word. As such, the final output of our algorithm will be:
$$
  \text{``the secount''}
$$
With cost $u(\text{``the''}) + u(\text{``secount''})$. However, note that the optimal split point would actually be:
$$
  \text{``these count''}
$$
with cost $u(\text{``these''}) + u(\text{``count''})$. We note that: 
$$
  u(\text{``these''}) + u(\text{``count''}) < u(\text{``the''}) + u(\text{``secount''})
$$
mainly because of an extremely high cost associated with $u(\text{``secount''})$.
\end{enumerate}
